# Technical Neural Networks 17-18
Some of my code from my time at the lecture TNN at the University of Bonn (WS 2017/18). It was implemented mostly in Python2 and NumPy. The following are contained in this project:

### Assignment_PA_D: Multi Neural Gas Model
A python based implementation of multi-neural gas model.

### Assignment_PA_E: Regional and Online Learnable Field
A python based implementation of the ROLF model.
